Bayesian Statistics Without Tears: A Sampling-Resampling Perspective by Smith and Gelfand is a highly cited paper by Smith and Gelfand discussing sampling methodologies for Bayesian Inference.

In their application to synthetic data, there is a major typo in their likelihood function. The correct likelihood function is:

In this document, maximum likelihood estimation is used to calculate the values for the parameters and plot a contour plot.
